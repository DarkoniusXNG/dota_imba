"DOTA_Tooltip_ability_imba_techies_proximity_mine_Description"				"Plant an invisible mine that becomes visible if an enemy is within the trigger range of the mine. The mine detonates if an enemy is standing within the trigger range for %explosion_delay% seconds. The explosion deals full damage in the blast radius, and deals %building_damage_pct%% damage to buildings.\n<font color='#FF7800'>Mine Cart:</font> Grants the Mine Cart modifier, which acts as charges. Charges are replenished over time, up to a maximum of mines. For each stack of Mine Cart, the cost of Proximity Mines increases by %mana_increase_per_stack%. Casting Proximity Mines consumes all charges, and adds a mine for each stack consumed. One mine is always set in the target point, while the rest are placed in a set distance from each other. Each mine is independent of other mines and work normally whenever an enemy comes into its range. The range of the explosion increases with levels, but an enemy still need to be in the trigger range for a mine to tick and explode."
