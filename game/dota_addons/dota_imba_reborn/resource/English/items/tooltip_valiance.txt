Any damage before reductions that would normally be received in this manner is stored into Countershield.\n<h1>Active: Countershield</h1> Within %counter_duration% after Royal Guard ends, Valiance can be cast as a point-target ability. Dashes towards the point and shield bashes %counter_distance% radius in front of the caster. Hit enemies take %counter_damage_percent%%% of Royal Guard's stored damage as pure damage, and are knocked back and upwards for %counter_knockback_duration% seconds. The damage pierces spell immunity, whereas the knockback only pierces spell immunity if the stored damage exceeds %counter_stun_threshold%.\n<h1>Passive: Damage Block</h1> Grants a %block_chance%%% chance to block %block_damage_melee% damage from incoming attacks on melee heroes, and %block_damage_ranged% damage on ranged."
