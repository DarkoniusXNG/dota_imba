"ingame_advertizing_description"					"The decision was made to start imba code from scratch. This means every extra components will be disabled, some forever and others until they're reworked and optimized. Here's the list of planned features: \n- A full copy of turbo mode rules \n- Permanent Frantic \n- Town Portal Scrolls and Boots of Travel will not have halved cooldowns due to permanent Frantic \n- 10 IMBAfied heroes with code formatted and optimized every major patches (expected timeframe is 2 weeks for each set of 10 heroes). \nAny help is welcome by testing and reporting issues, or help programming. Dota IMBA has always been a communautary project under a project leader, more contributors means faster fixes, more content and more ideas to add to the game."
